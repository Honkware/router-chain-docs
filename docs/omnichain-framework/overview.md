## Motivation
Even though a number of cross-chain message transfer frameworks have come to fore in the last couple of years, there have been none that offer the ability for the developers to incorporate custom bridging logic within their cross-chain dApp. Although most cross-chain applications can work well with a generic message transfer approach, there are a few that need a solution that affords them greater level of control over their dApps. 

## About OmniChain
Router's OmniChain framework leverages Router Chain's architectural components to allow developers to create seamless cross-chain applications with custom bridging logic. It even allows them to deploy their application-specific security layer on top of the infra-level security layer provided by Router. By allowing developers to program their logic on just one smart contract on the Router Chain, Router's OmniChain framework will reduce code redundancy and save developers' time and effort.
