# Nitro Forwarders
Basics about Nitro forwarders


## Intro to Nitro Forwarders
In simple terms, the Nitro forwarder is a permissionless module that listens to the Nitro deposit event from
the source chain and settles the request for the user on the destination chain. It is 
a Go service that handles cross-chain messages and token transactions across 
blockchain networks. It starts with the **`run`** function, which listens to 
blockchain events and relays data as needed. This modular system includes separate 
listeners and relayers for each blockchain, managed by a central processor. It 
features comprehensive logging, error management, and health monitoring for reliability.

## Components of a Nitro Forwarder
### Listener
Nitro Listener is a sub-module within the Nitro forwarder that captures events from 
blockchains, specifically from the "Asset Forwarder" contract. For every supported 
chain, there will be a listener instance of a forwarder that will listen to the 
events emitted from that chain.

It stores the processed block number, and it resumes from the last processed block 
to avoid reprocessing. The `ProcessInboundEvents` method fetches and processes 
new events, including `fundDepositedEvents` and `fundDepositedWithMessageEvents`, 
and updates the database with the latest event information. If errors occur, the 
listener stops.

### Processor
The **RequestProcessor** works on queued database requests (`msgTxqArray`), 
continuously pulling unprocessed transactions and marking 
them as `Picked` to avoid duplication. It processes transactions 
based on their type using specific methods and updates a registry to handle 
transactions on the appropriate blockchain.

### Chain Relayer

For every supported chain, the forwarder will run a relayer sub-module: the **ChainRelayer** module runs 
continuously, waiting for messages on two channels to relay funds and messages. It validates 
incoming messages and uses the `IRelay` method for processing. Errors are 
logged, and successful messages are processed further.

**Executor:**
As part of the relayer, the Executor prepares transaction data, estimates gas 
costs, and checks for profitability. It sends transactions through
**`assetForwarderWrapper`**, waits for confirmation, and
updates the database with transaction details.

The relayer sub-module within a Nitro forwarder is different from Router Chain relayers.
