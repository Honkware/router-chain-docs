# Overview


---

In the rapidly evolving world of decentralized applications (Dapps), building and
deploying even testnet applications across multiple blockchain networks can be a
complex and time-consuming process. Developers often face challenges such as obtaining testnet
funds, programming the cross-chain functionality, and deploying their applications.
However, with the introduction of Router Sandbox, these hurdles are a thing of the past.
Router Sandbox is an intuitive prototyping environment that simplifies the compilation,
deployment, and interaction with sample iDapps (interoperable Dapps) across multiple chains.
