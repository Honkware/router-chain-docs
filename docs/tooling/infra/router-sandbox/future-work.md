description: Improvements planned for Router Sandbox
---

In the current state, Router Sandbox is still a very rudimentary application. In the future, we plan to convert it into a full-fledged prototyping application by adding support for:
<ol type="a">
<li> non-EVM chains like Near, Solana, among others;</li>
<li>MetaMask and other Web3 wallets to allow contract deployments directly from usersâ€™ personal accounts;</li>
<li>compiling and deploying custom contracts (besides the template contracts like Ping Pong, XERC20, etc.);</li>
<li>importing and interacting with any verified iDapp contract.</li>
</ol>
