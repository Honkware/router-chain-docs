## Intuitive UI
A key strength of Router Sandbox lies in its intuitive user interface. The platform is designed to be user-friendly, making it accessible to Web 3.0 users of all levels of expertise. Whether you're a seasoned developer or new to the world of decentralized applications, Router Sandbox's intuitive design and straightforward functionality ensure that you can easily navigate and utilize the platform without extensive technical knowledge. If you still have any trouble using the platform, feel free to refer to our guide on using Router Sandbox given here. 


## One-click Deployment
Router Sandbox eliminates the complexities of deploying iDapps by offering a one-click deployment feature. Users can choose the iDapp they want to deploy and select the chains where they should be deployed. With just one click, Router Sandbox automatically handles the deployment process, providing users with a ready-to-use cross-chain application. This streamlined approach saves considerable time and effort for users to test out the capabilities of the Router chain.

## Support for Multiple Chains
Router Sandbox supports multiple testnet networks, including Fuji (Avalanche), Mumbai (Polygon), Arbitrum Goerli, Mantle Ringwood Testnet, and Scroll Testnet. In addition to these chains, Router Sandbox is committed to expanding its chain support and ensuring compatibility with new and emerging blockchain networks.

## Multiple iDapps to Choose From
Router Sandbox offers users the flexibility to choose from various iDapps based on their requirements. Currently, users can deploy the following applications:
1. Cross-chain Ping Pong: This application allows users to send a message (ping) from the source chain to the destination chain and receive an acknowledgment (pong) back on the source chain. It demonstrates the seamless communication between different blockchain networks.
2. Cross-chain ERC20: An ERC20 token with built-in cross-chain transfer capabilities. This iDapp showcases the interoperability of tokens across multiple chains, enabling users to transfer assets seamlessly.
3. Cross-chain NFT (ERC721 or ERC1155): This iDapp enables the creation and transfer of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) across different blockchain networks. Users can experience the cross-chain functionality of NFTs and explore their potential in various use cases.

## Transparency
Router Sandbox understands the importance of transparency in the development and deployment process. To provide users with a clear understanding of the workflow, Router Sandbox offers a step-by-step view of the entire process. From setting up an account with testnet funds to deploying a cross-chain application and verifying the contracts, users have full visibility into each stage of the journey. This transparency facilitates a deeper understanding of the intricacies of cross-chain dApp development.
