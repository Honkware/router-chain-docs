# Introduction

The list of available infrastructural tools to simplify the process of building on Router.

| **Infra** | **Purpose** |	**Users** |
| -------- | -------- |  -------- |
| **Router Scan** | You can use this tool to view and analyze transactions, blocks, and cross-chain requests on the Router Chain. Additionally, you can access validator data here including their stake and uptime, among other details.| **a) Interoperable dApps (iDapps)** built on Router can use this tool to track their cross-chain transactions. <br />**b) Projects** built directly on the Router Chain can use this tool to track the status of their transactions. <br />**c) Retail users** performing transactions on the Router Chain can track their actions on this explorer.|
| **Router Station** | Use this tool to instantiate contracts on the Router Chain, execute transactions on them, and upgrade them if required. | **Developers** building contracts on the Router Chain can use this tool for easier deployment and management of thier contracts.|
| **Router Robot** | You can use this tool for end-to-end testing, behavior driven development (BDD) and robotic process automation (RPA). | **Developers** building iDapps using Router's infra can use this tool to test their applications.|
| **Relayer** | Relayers can trustlessly relay outbound transaction to destination chain. | a. **dApps** can run their own application specific relayers to process their outbound transactions. <br /> b. Any user who want to run a trustless relayer for Router Chain's outbound requests and earn the relayer fees for each transaction committed on destination chain.|
