# Your First OmniChain dApp
In this section, we'll provide a step-by-step guide for how users can deploy their first cross-chain dApp that leverages the middleware infra enabled by the Router Chain.

Before diving into the guide, it's important to understand Router's <a href="../key-concepts/high-level-architecture" target="_blank">high-level architecture</a>. Once you have gained a basic understanding of how a cross-chain application works on the Router Chain, you can read through this guide that will cover the following sections:

-   Setting up Router's EVM Devnet to deploy and test sample cross-chain applications
-   Deploying a sample application contract (Solidity) on Router's EVM Devnet
-   Deploying a sample bridge contract (CosmWasm) on Router's Alpha Devnet
<!-- -   Testing the end-to-end workflow -->

At the end of the guide, we'll have two working contracts:
1. An application contract on Router's EVM Devnet acting as both the source and destination contract
2. A bridge contract on the Router Chain
