title: Sample Ping Pong Contract with ASM
sidebar_position: 4
---

To integrate custom ASM into an application as basic as a cross-chain Ping Pong dApp, the user can follow the steps mentioned below.

* For the uninitiated, Ping Pong is an app where users can send a custom message (ping) from the source chain to the destination chain and receive an ack (pong) back on the source chain.
* After deploying the application contract (Ping Pong) and the ASM contract (a sample is provided in the [previous section](./sample-delayed-execution-asm-contract)) on the respective chains, the user needs to provide the address for the destination chain ASM contract deployed in `bytes` format while initiating a cross-chain request from the source chain in the `requestMetadata`. In the example below, the same is being done in the `iPing` function.

The code snippet for a Ping Pong application is given below:
