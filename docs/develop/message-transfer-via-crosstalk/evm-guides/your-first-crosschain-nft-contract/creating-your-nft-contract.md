title: Creating a Sample Cross-Chain NFT Contract

To create cross-chain applications using the Router infrastructure, users will have to build and deploy application contracts on various third-party chains. This section describes how to create a cross-chain NFT smart contract.

## **Part 1)** Create your Solidity smart contract

We simply inherit Openzeppelin's implementations of popular standard ERC1155, and extend the behavior to our needs. To make NFT cross-chain, we import Router Protocol's evm-gateway-contracts and utilise them as shown in the following code.

```javascript

import "@routerprotocol/evm-gateway-contracts@1.1.11/contracts/IDapp.sol";
import "@routerprotocol/evm-gateway-contracts@1.1.11/contracts/IGateway.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC1155/ERC1155.sol";

/// @title XERC1155
/// @notice A cross-chain ERC-1155 smart contract to demonstrate how one can create
/// cross-chain NFT contracts using Router CrossTalk.
contract XERC1155 is ERC1155, IDapp {
  // address of the owner
  address public owner;

  // address of the Gateway contract
  IGateway public gatewayContract;

  // chain type + chain id => address of our contract in string format
  mapping(string => string) public ourContractOnChains;

  // transfer params struct where we specify which NFTs should be transferred to
  // the destination chain and to which address
  struct TransferParams {
    uint256[] nftIds;
    uint256[] nftAmounts;
    bytes nftData;
    bytes recipient;
  }

  constructor(
    string memory _uri,
    address payable gatewayAddress,
    string memory feePayerAddress
  ) ERC1155(_uri) {
    gatewayContract = IGateway(gatewayAddress);
    owner = msg.sender;

    // minting ourselves some NFTs so that we can test out the contracts
    _mint(msg.sender, 1, 10, "");

    gatewayContract.setDappMetadata(feePayerAddress);
  }

  /// @notice function to set the fee payer address on Router Chain.
  /// @param feePayerAddress address of the fee payer on Router Chain.
  function setDappMetadata(string memory feePayerAddress) external {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "only owner");

  }

    ourContractOnChains[chainId] = contractAddress;
  }

  /// @notice function to generate a cross-chain NFT transfer request.

    // burning the NFTs from the address of the user calling _burnBatch function
    _burnBatch(msg.sender, transferParams.nftIds, transferParams.nftAmounts);

    bytes memory requestPacket = abi.encode(

    );

    gatewayContract.iSend{ value: msg.value }(
      1,
      0,
      string(""),
      destChainId,
      requestMetadata,
      requestPacket
    );
  }

## **Part 2)** Cross-Chain functions in brief

### **1)** transferCrossChain Function

This function is responsible for creating a cross-chain NFT-transfer request. It first burns the NFT from contract on source chain, utilises Gateway contracts' `ISend` function to send request to mint the NFT to the user on the destination chain.

### **2)** IReceive Function

Once a cross-chain request is initiated from the source chain, the message will be delivered to the destination chain which is received by `IReceive` function that decodes the data and mints the NFT to the user.
